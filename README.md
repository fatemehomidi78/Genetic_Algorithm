Abstract

Optimization problems lie at the heart of hydroinformatics, where the quest for efficient resource allocation and decision-making is paramount. In our project, we tackled an optimization challenge aimed at maximizing the objective function

To tackle this problem, we employed genetic algorithms (GAs), a powerful optimization technique inspired by the principles of natural selection and evolution. We implemented the GA in both MATLAB and Python environments, exploring different strategies to efficiently search for the optimal solution within the given constraints.

In MATLAB, we utilized a roulette wheel selection mechanism for parent selection, coupled with a single-point crossover technique and a mutation rate of 0.01. This approach allowed us to explore the solution space effectively, leveraging the genetic operators to evolve towards the optimal solution.

In Python, we experimented with two different implementations: one incorporating elitism and another without it. Elitism, a strategy that preserves the best individuals from one generation to the next, aimed to maintain diversity and prevent premature convergence. By comparing the performance of the two implementations, we gained valuable insights into the impact of elitism on convergence speed and solution quality.

Through rigorous experimentation and analysis, we evaluated the efficiency and effectiveness of our genetic algorithm approach in solving the optimization problem. Our results not only demonstrate the versatility of genetic algorithms in hydroinformatics but also provide practical insights into the selection of appropriate parameters and strategies for tackling similar optimization challenges in the field.
